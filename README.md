## Introduction

This repo contains my configuration of kitty, tmux, ranger, zsh and neovim.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ch3n9w/dev
cd dev
# install dependency software and install configuration
./scripts/install-software.sh
# install fonts
./scripts/install-font.sh
```

Alternatively (if you dont want to install all of them), you can copy the configuration directory you like to XDG_CONFIG_HOME, for example:

```
nvim -> ~/.config/nvim
kitty -> ~/.config/kitty
tmux -> ~/.config/tmux
ranger -> ~/.config/ranger
zsh/zsh -> ~/.config/zsh
zsh/zshrc -> ~/.zshrc
```

## Uninstall

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh
```

## Noteable Info

### Kitty

1. use Firacode Nerd Font and Victor Mono Nerd Font, use LXGW WenKai for Chinese characters.

### Tmux

1. commonly used keys are set as shortcuts that dont require prefix key, which can still be used though
2. Ctrl-hjkl and Ctrl-q can be used both in tmux and vim for window operations.
3. use tmux-continuum and resurrect to restore workspaces.
4. If you get dizzy remembering shortcuts, just use your mouse.

### Zsh

1. customize powerlevel10k for a more compact look, check `zsh/zsh/theme.zsh`
2. settings about software are in `zsh/zsh/plugins`, you can add here by yourself
3. disable vim mode for consistence.

### Neovim

1. most keybindings are in `nvim/lua/keymap/init.lua`, others are in plugins' file.

### Ranger

1. integrate with fzf, you can press `f` to fuzzy search files and directories from pwd, press `F` to fuzzy search files and directories from home directory.
2. add custom commands so you can copy and paste items across different ranger instances!
3. all other modes' keybindings are discarded, only normal mode is used for simplicity.

## Other

Highly recommended to install key, it's a great tool to remap capslock to esc and ctrl, see [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd)

## Trouble Shooting

If you have installed xsel and use my configuration under wayland, you may encounter clipboard problem, in which neovim use `xsel` as clipboard provider instead of `wl-copy`, to solve the problem, just uninstall `xsel`.
