# Personal Development Toolkit ðŸ“¡

This repo contains my configuration of kitty, tmux, lf, zsh and neovim.

## Try

You can try my configuration in docker container.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ch3n9w/dev
cd dev
docker build . -t dev:latest
docker run -it dev:latest /bin/zsh
```
## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ch3n9w/dev
cd dev
# install dependency software and install configuration
./scripts/install-software.sh
```

Alternatively (if you dont want to install all of them), you can copy the configuration directory you like to XDG_CONFIG_HOME, for example:

```
nvim -> ~/.config/nvim
kitty -> ~/.config/kitty
tmux -> ~/.config/tmux
lf -> ~/.config/lf
zsh/zsh -> ~/.config/zsh
zsh/zshrc -> ~/.zshrc
```

## Noteable Info

- Kitty
  - use JetbrainMono Nerd Font and LXGW WenKai, please install them by yourself.
- Tmux
  - commonly used keys are set as shortcuts that dont require prefix key, which can still be used though
  - Ctrl-hjkl and Ctrl-q can be used both in tmux and vim for window operations.
  - use tmux-continuum and resurrect to restore workspaces.
  - If you get dizzy remembering shortcuts, just use your mouse.
- Zsh
  - settings about software are in `zsh/zsh/plugins`, you can add here by yourself
  - disable vim mode for consistence.
  - customize `context` module of powerlevel10k
- Neovim
  - most keybindings are in `nvim/lua/keymap.lua`, others are in plugins' file.
  - disgard f/F t/T inline search and only use global search enhanced by flash.nvim.
  - the completion behavior simulate vscode's, which is more intuitive:)
- lf
  - integrate with fzf, you can press `f` to fuzzy search files and directories from pwd
  - since lf use `rifle` to open file in my config, ranger is still needed.
