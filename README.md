# Personal Development Toolkit ðŸ“¡

## Introduction

This repo contains my configuration of kitty, tmux, ranger, zsh and neovim.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ch3n9w/dev
cd dev
# if you want to install in desktop environment
./scripts/install-desktop.sh
# if you only want to install in server environment
./scripts/install-server.sh
```

Alternatively (if you dont want to install all of them), you can copy the configuration directory you like to XDG_CONFIG_HOME, for example:

```
nvim -> ~/.config/nvim
kitty -> ~/.config/kitty
tmux -> ~/.config/tmux
ranger -> ~/.config/ranger
zsh/zsh -> ~/.config/zsh
zsh/zshrc -> ~/.zshrc
```

## Uninstall

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh
```

## Noteable Info

### Kitty

1. use Firacode Nerd Font and Victor Mono Nerd Font, use LXGW WenKai for Chinese characters.

### Tmux

1. all keybindings does not require prefix key, which can still be used though.
2. Ctrl-hjkl and Ctrl-q can be used both in tmux and vim for window operations.
3. use tmux-continuum and resurrect to restore workspaces.
4. If you get dizzy remembering shortcuts, just use your mouse.

### Zsh

1. it contains some useless alias for Personal use, you can delete them.

### Neovim

1. most keybindings are in `nvim/lua/keymap/init.lua`, some keybindings are in `cmp.lua`, `filetree.lua`, `dashboard.lua`, `lspsaga.lua`, `treesitter.lua` and `surround.lua`

### Other

Highly recommended to install key, it's a great tool to remap capslock to esc and ctrl, see [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd)

## Trouble Shooting

If you have installed xsel and use my configuration under wayland, you may encounter clipboard problem, in which neovim use `xsel` as clipboard provider instead of `wl-copy`, to solve the problem, just uninstall `xsel`.
